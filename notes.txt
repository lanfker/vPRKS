Question: 
  1. How to get \Phi_i ?????


Facts:
  1. What information a packet has to contain:
    (a) (how to get the value)receive power?? (fill in at receiver side)  since signal map should be constructed in the MAC layer. Double
    (b) travelling angle. Double
    (c) current position (x,y). Two double

Thoughts:
  1. We should not let vehicles send packets with abnormal high transmission power. This means when constructing signal map, we need message exchange.  Use prediction:
  (a) Only store signal attenuation information if packets are succesfully received. 
  (b) Use these records to predict path loss netween nearby vehicles that are beyond transmission range.
  (c) For predicted values, we should not store them in the observation matrix (vectors), only update them in the signal map.
